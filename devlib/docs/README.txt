While the SoftSmithy Utility Library (lib) is a general utility library,
the SoftSmithy Development Utility Library (devlib) provides utility classes for
development, deployment, set up etc.
You typically won't want/ need this library on the classpath of your application
(runtime).

Note: This is a pre-alpha version and the API is still subject to change! If you
have any questions or comments feel free to contact me: 
puce@users.sourceforge.net

Note: This library has the following dependencies:
- JPA (tested with EclipseLink 2.0)
- JUnit 4.5
- SoftSmithy Utility Library
